========================================================================================================================================

AI developer
--------------------

I specialize in neural network development using TensorFlow and PyTorch frameworks. I also have experience working with NumPy, Pandas, Keras, SkLearn and other libraries for data analysis and preprocessing.
Moving into neural network development was a logical career step for me. I have always been fascinated by technology and its potential to solve complex problems. My previous work as a system administrator gave me a good foundation in understanding programming and algorithms, but I wanted to apply my knowledge in a more practical area: developing effective machine learning algorithms, analyzing data and creating intelligent systems that can improve decision-making processes, automate routine tasks and increase work efficiency.
I am actively interested in the latest advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning, which allows me to quickly master new technologies and apply them in practice.
I am motivated by the opportunity to work on interesting projects, constantly learn and develop.
